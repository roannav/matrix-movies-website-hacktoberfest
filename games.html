          <p class="heading">Review</p>
          <p class="para"><span class="highlight">7.2/10</span> By IGN</p>
          <p class="heading">Description</p>
          <p class="para">Enter the Matrix is a 2003 <span class="highlight">action-adventure video game</span> developed by <span class="highlight">Shiny Entertainment</span> and published by <span class="highlight">Infogrames under the Atari brand name</span>. 
            It was the first game based on The Matrix film series. Its story is <span class="highlight">concurrent</span> with that of the film <span class="highlight">The Matrix Reloaded</span> and features over an hour of <span class="highlight">original footage</span>, 
            written and directed by the <span class="highlight">Wachowskis</span> and starring the cast of the films, produced for the game.
          </p>
          <p class="para"><span class="highlight">Released in May 2003</span>, the same month as The Matrix Reloaded, 
            Enter the Matrix was <span class="highlight">simultaneously</span> produced with The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. 
            While it received mixed reviews from critics, the game sold <span class="highlight">5 million copies</span> as of May 2004.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            Enter the Matrix gives players control of two of the supporting characters from Reloaded and Revolutions, 
            <span class="highlight">Ghost (Anthony Wong) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith)</span>, members of the same group of rebels as Morpheus, 
            Trinity, and Neo, the protagonists of the series. Niobe is the <span class="highlight">Captain of the Logos</span>, the fastest ship in the rebel fleet. 
            Ghost is the ship's first mate, weapons guru, and a deep-thinking, philosophical assassin. 
            The game takes place at roughly the same time as the events in Reloaded.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            Players play as either Niobe or Ghost, 
            each of whom have slight variations during their story. 
            Most levels involve controlling players in a <span class="highlight">third-person perspective</span>, 
            using guns and fighting skills to defeat opponents and complete level objectives. 
            At any time, players can activate <span class="highlight">bullet time</span> (called <span class="highlight">"Focus"</span> in the game) which slows down time, 
            giving players the ability to perform actions such as <span class="highlight">shooting in midair and dodging bullets</span>. 
            Some levels involve one-on-one martial arts fighting against single opponents. 
            In levels involving vehicles, such as driving a car or piloting the Logos, the style of game play depends on the <span class="highlight">selected player</span>, 
            commonly with Niobe maneuvering the vehicles to avoid obstacles, whilst Ghost takes control of a gun to fight off incoming enemies. 
            A hacking system allows players to enter codes, which can unlock special skills, weapons and secrets, such as a 2-player versus mode.

          <p class="heading">Description</p>
          <p class="para">The Matrix: Path of Neo is a 2005 <span class="highlight">action-adventure</span> video game developed by <span class="highlight">Shiny Entertainment and published by Atari</span>. 
            The game was written and co-directed by the <span class="highlight">Wachowskis</span>, who wrote and directed the first three The Matrix films and the 2003 video game Enter the Matrix, 
            also developed by Shiny Entertainment. Players control the character <span class="highlight">Neo</span>, participating in scenes from the films.The game received mixed reviews from critics.</p>
          <p class="para">The Matrix: Path of Neo allows the player to participate in many of the <span class="highlight">major action scenes in the films</span>. 
            Most of these sequences, picked by the movie directors themselves, are taken from the first film in the series.
          </p>
          <p class="para">At the start of the game, the player is hacker <span class="highlight">Thomas Anderson</span>, 
              and does not possess any of the powers that the character will later discover as Neo. 
              He has to find his way through by <span class="highlight">stealth and basic brawl</span>. As the game continues, players learn new skills and techniques, 
              equipping Neo for the final showdown with Agent Smith. These <span class="highlight">additional skills</span> may be <span class="highlight">level</span> and in the main game. 
              Many of these skills are used by Neo in the trilogy, including the <span class="highlight">bullet dodge, bullet stop, and flight</span> 
              A number of weapons are available in the game, consisting of both <span class="highlight">melee weapons</span> (including various types of swords, staves, and escrimas) and 
              <span class="highlight">firearms</span> (assault rifle, sub-machine gun, pistol etc.).
          </p>
          <p class="para">The game also allows the player to meet many of the characters in the films, 
              including <span class="highlight">Trinity, Morpheus and the Merovingian</span>, among others.
              The game uses <span class="highlight">film excerpts</span> as cut scenes throughout the game at certain milestones. 
              This footage includes clips from the <span class="highlight">original The Matrix theatrical films</span>, and from other sources, 
              including the short film series, <span class="highlight">The Animatrix and Enter the Matrix</span>.
              The PC & Xbox versions also lack certain visual effects compared to the PS2 version such as the image warping.

          <p class="heading">Description</p>
          <p class="para">The Matrix Awakens is a 2021 <span class="highlight">open-world video game and technology demonstration</span> developed by Epic Games 
            using <span class="highlight">Unreal Engine 5</span> in partnership with Warner Bros. Pictures, The Coalition, Wētā FX, Evil Eye Pictures, SideFX, 
            and others for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S, serving as a marketing tie-in for the 2021 film The Matrix Resurrections.
          </p>
          <p class="para">Released during the 2021 Game Awards on <span class="highlight">December 9, 2021</span>, 
            it features Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Neo (Keanu Reeves), along with <span class="highlight">photorealistic 3D-scanned models</span> of both Moss and Reeves from the present time, 
            portrayed by themselves, in cinematic and QTE shooter scenes where the player can take control of IO, 
            a character which Epic introduced with <span class="highlight">Unreal's MetaHuman creator tool</span>
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            While the <span class="highlight">demo did not get a PC release</span>, 
            Epic released the city environment in the demo as a <span class="highlight">sample project titled "City Sample"</span> in their Unreal Engine 5 workshop. 
            This was immediately used by fans to generate a Windows executable package in which the city can be navigated, 
            offering the ability to control several parameters of the game engine, the game also features <span class="highlight">NPCs with AI</span> that will generate conversations when players use the audio. 
            The assets were also reused later in several fan-made demos featuring characters such as Spider-Man and Batman.
